# Milestone 1
CST-150

 Part 1: Design an initial model for the data in your application. The data model should include at least five applicable properties. Property data types are stated and appropriate, property names are self-documenting.
 
This project is dedicated to building an inventory application. An inventory helps maintain and track what items are in stock and various other attributes such as name or cost. This initial model has 5 different data types used to manage an inventory system. The first data type is “Game Title” used as the nomenclature of an item which will be stored as a string. The second data type is “UPC” assigned to items as unique identifiers and will be stored as a string. The third data type is “Game Cost” used to indicate how much an individual items costs and will be stored as a double. The fourth data type is “Quantity” which shows how much of an item is in stock and is stored as an integer. The fifth data type is “Game Genre” used to indicate what genre of items that an game belongs under and is stored as a string.

 Part 2: Sketch a low-fidelity prototype (hand-drawing) of the flow of interactions in your application.
